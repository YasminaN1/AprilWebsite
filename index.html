                <p>James sprinted across the glowing marble court, heart pounding harder than the thunder above. The
                    opposing team
                    moved like shadows: silent, fast, perfect. Every block they made echoed through the air like a
                    judge’s gavel. But James… he was starting to keep up. He spun past one player and leapt. The sky
                    above cracked with lightning. SLAM. The ghostly crowd gasped in
                    unison. Score: 1 – 0
                    For the first time in what might have been centuries, The Challenger had scored. James turned — and
                    froze. The tallest figure, the Captain of the House of Storm, removed their mask. </p>

                <p>Underneath wasn’t a ghost. It was a version of him — older, sharper, wearing a crown. “Every champion
                    becomes part of the game,” the Captain said. “Win… and you’ll be free. Lose…
                    and you’ll become one of us.” He saw them now — the team in silver weren’t
                    strangers. They were past challengers. Something burned inside him. “Then I’ll break the game.” He
                    dribbled once. He passed to no one — only himself, behind the back, between the legs — a
                    dance of rhythm and rebellion. With a final leap, he threw the ball high. Not toward the hoop. At
                    the scoreboard.

                <p>The scoreboard shattered in a burst of light. The storm halted mid-roar. And all around him, the
                    court began to crumble — like a spell breaking after too long. The players vanished into ash and
                    wind. The Captain smiled sadly… and nodded. “Well played.” Then everything went white. James woke up
                    on the old, cracked court behind his neighborhood. The storm was gone. The night was quiet. But in
                    his hand… was a glowing, golden basketball. Legend says if you play in the storm… the game might
                    call you, too. The End. </p>
